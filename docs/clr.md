Combine Features Logistic Regression <sup>beta</sup>
=================
Introduction
------------
>In recommendation or online advertising, source data often come with different channels characterizing different dimensions, such as
>
> - data including age, gender, marital status ...
> - data including internet behavior ...
> - data including phone brand ...
> - data including APP installed ...
> - ...
> 
> Combining features with different dimensions into one always gets better ctr(cvr),
> so we release the Combine Features Logistic Regression. 
> 

Quick Start
------------
>CLR.run/ is defined as below:
>
> - the elemnt of *data* is single instance/sample arranged as *(Array[fregata.Vector], fregata.Num)*
> 	- features from the same channel should be putted into same *fregata.Vector* by sort
> 	- the size of *Array[fregata.Vector]* denotes the number of source datas' channels
> 	- every channel's *fregata.Vector*  should be putted into *Array[fregata.Vector]* by sort
> 	- *fregata.Num* denotes the instance's label 
> - *combines* denotes how to combine different channels' features. For example *combines=Array(Array(0,1,2),  Array(2))* says that
> 	- source datas are from 3 different channels
> 	- suppose that channel#1's size is **r**, channel#2's is **m**, channel#3's is **n**
> 	- *Array(0,1,2)* says that **r**x**m**x**n** combined features are generated by [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product), and each combined feature is generated by 3 features selected from different channels 
> 	- *Array(2)* says that we should reserve all the features from channel#3
> 	- based on the example above, the total number of features is **r**x**m**x**n**+**n**
> 
>```scala
  def run(data: RDD[(Array[fregata.Vector], fregata.Num)],
      combines: Array[Array[Int]],
      iterationNum: Int = 1): CLRModel
>```
>

>CLRModel.clrPredict is defined as below
>
> - parameter *data*'s structure is the same as **CLR.run'**s
>
>```
>	def clrPredict(data: RDD[(Array[fregata.Vector], fregata.Num)]): 
>		RDD[((Array[fregata.Vector], fregata.Num), (fregata.Num, fregata.Num))]
>```
Example
------------
```scala
  /**
   * Created by takun on 16/9/19.
   */
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("logistic regression")
    val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
    val (_,trainData) = LibSvmReader.read(sc,"/Volumes/takun/data/libsvm/a9a",123)
    val (_,testData) = LibSvmReader.read(sc,"/Volumes/takun/data/libsvm/a9a.t",123)
    val model = CLR.run(trainData.map{
      case (x,label) => Array(x) -> label
    },Array(Array(0,0)),10)
    val pd = model.clrPredict(testData.map{
      case (x,label) => Array(x) -> label
    })
    val acc = Accuracy.of( pd.map{
      case ((x,l),(p,c)) =>
        c -> l
    })
    println( s"Accuracy = $acc ")
    val auc = AreaUnderRoc.of( pd.map{
      case ((x,l),(p,c)) =>
        p -> l
    })
    println( s"AreaUnderRoc = $auc ")
  }
```

    Accuracy = 0.8462719567620686 
    AreaUnderRoc = 0.900320784272655
